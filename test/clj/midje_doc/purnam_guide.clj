"Add to `project.clj` dependencies: 

`[im.chit/purnam `\"`{{PROJECT.version}}`\"`]`"

"Looking for documentation for `purnam.angular`? The library has been renamed and moved to a new home at [http://purnam.github.io/gyr](http://purnam.github.io/gyr)"

[[:chapter {:title "Motivation"}]]

"
[purnam](https://www.github.com/purnam/purnam) is a *clojurescript* library designed to provide better clojurescript/javascript interop, testing and documentation tools to the programmer. Current projects requiring interface with external javascript libraries will greatly benefit from `purnam` language extensions. 'Pure' clojure/clojurescript libraries will also benefit with its unit-testing and documentation workflows. The library was written to solve a number of pain points that are experienced in clojurescript development:

#### Better JS Interop

The first pain point was having to deal with the clojurish `(.dot syntax)` for javascript interop as well as a lack of functionality when working with native js objects. This made it especially hard for working with any external js library. `purnam` offers:

- [purnam.native.functions](#purnam-native-functions) - functions for native objects and arrays
- [purnam.native](#purnam-native) - clojure protocols for native objects and arrays
- [purnam.core](#purnam-js) - a set of macros allowing javascript-like syntax for better interop

#### In-Browser Testing

The second pain point was the lack of testing tools that worked with the browser. I wanted something with more debugging power and so unit testing is integrated with the [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) test runner using two different test styles:

- [purnam.test](#purnam-test) - testing using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) flavored or [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje) flavored syntax.

#### Integrated Documentation

The third pain point was the lack of documentation tools for clojurescript as well as clojure. `purnam` is compatible with [midje-doc](https://www.github.com/zcaudate/lein-midje-doc) so that the integrated testing and documentation [workflow](http://z.caudate.me/combining-tests-and-documentation/) can be also used in clojurescript.
